//! Pure math for packing/unpacking `LPARAM` coordinate pairs in window
//! messages — `WM_MOUSEMOVE`, `WM_LBUTTONDOWN`, `WM_RBUTTONUP`, and friends.
//!
//! Windows packs the click `(x, y)` into a single `LPARAM` (`MAKELPARAM` in
//! `windowsx.h`): low 16 bits hold `x`, high 16 bits hold `y`. The receiver
//! extracts with `GET_X_LPARAM` / `GET_Y_LPARAM`, which sign-extend each half
//! via `(int)(short)LOWORD(lp)` — so negative client-area coordinates
//! (legitimately produced by `ScreenToClient` for clicks on a window that
//! straddles a monitor edge, or for non-client clicks above the title bar)
//! round-trip back to the same `i32` value, as long as each coordinate fits in
//! `i16` range.
//!
//! This module exists alongside [`crate::virtualdesk`] for the same reason:
//! the coordinate-handoff is the kind of pure math that needs cross-platform
//! unit tests on every host (issue #1979 — the agent reported correct
//! screen-points being delivered to the wrong monitor on multi-monitor setups
//! with negative virtual-desktop X origins, so we pin both the SendInput
//! [VIRTUALDESK normalization] and the PostMessage [LPARAM packing] paths
//! with regression tests on the macOS CI host).
//!
//! Audit conclusion for #1979: the existing PostMessage packing is correct
//! for every screen / client coordinate that fits in `i16` range, including
//! the reporter's `(-1198, 292)` and `(-1795, 383)` examples — the round-trip
//! through `GET_X_LPARAM` / `GET_Y_LPARAM` recovers the input exactly. The
//! tests below lock that invariant in so a future "simplification" (e.g.
//! dropping the implicit `i16` truncation and going `x as u32` directly)
//! cannot regress it without turning a test red.

/// Pack a `(x, y)` coordinate pair into the 32-bit `LPARAM` payload used by
/// every `WM_MOUSE*` and `WM_*BUTTON*` message: `x` in the low 16 bits,
/// `y` in the high 16 bits, each truncated to `i16` width.
///
/// Returned as `u32` — the caller is responsible for the final `LPARAM`
/// (`isize`) cast. Splitting the pure-bit-math from the Win32 `LPARAM`
/// newtype lets this run in `cargo test` on any host.
///
/// Returns `Err` when either coordinate falls outside the `i16` range
/// `[-32768, 32767]`. Win32 packs the LPARAM as two `WORD`s (16 bits each),
/// so a coordinate outside that range would silently truncate to a different
/// value on the receiver — and the receiver has no way to distinguish that
/// from a legitimate small-magnitude coord. Every existing call site in
/// `mouse.rs` passes client-area coords that come out of `ScreenToClient`
/// (window-local, capped at the window's extents) so they're always inside
/// `i16` range in practice — the explicit fail-fast is the cheap insurance
/// against a future caller passing screen-direct coords on a >32k-pixel
/// virtual desktop.
