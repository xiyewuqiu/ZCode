//! Foreground-steal bypass for UWP / XAML / WinUI UIA activation calls.
//!
//! UWP/XAML/WinUI apps self-foreground during UIA `InvokePattern.Invoke`
//! (and `ExpandCollapse.Expand`, `Toggle.Toggle`, `SelectionItem.Select` —
//! anything the XAML message-loop processes as an input-like event). The
//! XAML host unconditionally calls `SetForegroundWindow(self)` when handling
//! those, stealing focus from whatever the user had on top.
//!
//! Wrapping the call in `EnableWindow(host, FALSE) / call / EnableWindow(host, TRUE)`
//! silently suppresses the self-activation while letting the UIA pattern call
//! still execute — UIA pattern delivery uses the kernel accessibility channel,
//! not the input queue gated by `EnableWindow`.
//!
//! Empirical evidence (`flash-repro/14-multi-uwp-v3.ps1`, 2026-05-24):
//!   - Baseline UIA Invoke against UWP Calculator num5 button: user's
//!     foreground window dropped below the target in 91% of poller samples.
//!   - With this bypass: 0/507 z-drops across Calculator, Clock, Settings.
//!
//! Chromium / Electron hosts (`Chrome_WidgetWin_*`) exhibit the identical
//! self-foreground during UIA `Invoke` and are covered by the same shield (the
//! gate also accepts `is_chromium_target_window`). On Windows their content
//! window calls `SetForegroundWindow(self)` from the Invoke handler — measured
//! 7/8 background ax-bg actions stole focus before this; the `EnableWindow`
//! shield blocks it because a disabled top-level cannot become foreground while
//! the Invoke still lands over the a11y channel.
//!
//! Non-UWP / non-Chromium classic Win32 apps don't exhibit the bug
//! (`flash-repro/15-non-uwp.ps1`, Notepad: 0/45 baseline z-drops). The bypass
//! is therefore gated on `is_xaml_host_hwnd || is_chromium_target_window` and is
//! a no-op for other hosts.
