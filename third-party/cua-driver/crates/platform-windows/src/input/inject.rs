//! Universal background mouse actuator: coordinate-routed pointer/touch
//! injection that delivers a click to whatever window sits under a screen
//! point **without** `SetForegroundWindow` and **without** moving the user's
//! mouse cursor.
//!
//! Why this exists: the PostMessage path (`mouse::post_click`) is invisible and
//! never raises, but Chromium/Electron/GTK/WPF content silently ignore posted
//! synthetic `WM_*BUTTON` messages — their input arrives through the *system
//! input queue*, not the per-window message queue. The historical fallback for
//! those was `send_click_synthesized` (SendInput + a `SetForegroundWindow`
//! swap), which is exactly the visible "flash" we want to eliminate.
//!
//! Touch injection routes by coordinate through the system input queue (so
//! Chromium et al. accept it; the OS promotes it to `WM_*BUTTON` for legacy
//! Win32 windows that don't consume `WM_POINTER`), and — per the RE in
//! `docs/windows-background-input-re-plan.md` §4.4 — the kernel injection path
//! (`NtUserInjectMouseInput`/`NtUserInjectTouchInput`) gates only on a
//! per-process injection-enable, NOT on the target being foreground. The one
//! residual is that a tap on an *inactive* top-level window can still trigger
//! click-activation; we contain that with `NoActivateGuard` (WS_EX_NOACTIVATE)
//! plus a `force_foreground_attached(prev_fg)` re-assertion of the USER's
//! foreground afterward. Per the macOS-aligned contract a background actuation
//! never raises/restacks the target: when coordinate-routed input can't reach
//! it (occluded at the point), the caller returns `background_unavailable`
//! rather than raising it (see `target_visible_at_point`).
//!
//! Scope: left-button taps (single/double/triple). Right/middle have no clean
//! touch mapping; callers fall back to their existing routing for those.
