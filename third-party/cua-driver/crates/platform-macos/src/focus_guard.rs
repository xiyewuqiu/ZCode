//! FocusGuard — Rust port of Swift's `FocusGuard.withFocusSuppressed`
//! (`libs/cua-driver/Sources/CuaDriverCore/Focus/FocusGuard.swift`).
//!
//! ## What this does
//!
//! Wraps an individual AX-action call (the inside of a click / type /
//! set_value / drag dispatch) with a **targeted** focus-steal suppression
//! lease. Catches the case where dispatching an AX attribute write
//! triggers a reflexive self-activation in the target app — Safari /
//! WebKit will sometimes pull itself to the front when an
//! `AXSelectedText` write hits a focused input, even when the AX call
//! itself doesn't go through `NSApp.activate(…)`.
//!
//! ## Layering relative to Swift
//!
//! Swift's `FocusGuard.withFocusSuppressed` does three things:
//!
//! 1. **Enablement** — set `AXManualAccessibility` /
//!    `AXEnhancedUserInterface` on the app root so Chromium/Electron
//!    targets respond to attribute-level dispatch.
//! 2. **Synthetic focus** — write `AXFocused` / `AXMain` on the
//!    enclosing window + element before the action, restore after.
//!    Makes AppKit behave as if the action came from a focused
//!    process, preventing reflex activations.
//! 3. **Reactive** — arm `SystemFocusStealPreventer` with a targeted
//!    entry. If the target self-activates anyway, re-activates the
//!    prior frontmost.
//!
//! This Rust port only ships **layer 3** (the reactive suppressor).
//! Layers 1+2 require AX assertion + AX attribute write/restore machinery
//! that isn't yet ported — and empirically the layer-3 reactive guard
//! catches the majority of side-effects when combined with
//! `WindowChangeDetector`'s wildcard lease at the snapshot→detect
//! boundary. This gap is a known, intentional limitation.
//!
//! ## Why this is a separate module
//!
//! `focus_steal::with_suppression` already exists as a thin closure
//! API around the dispatcher. `focus_guard::with_focus_suppressed`
//! wraps it with:
//!
//! 1. A "is target already frontmost?" check so we don't arm a useless
//!    self→self suppressor (matches Swift's `isTargetFrontmost` guard).
//! 2. A 50ms post-action sleep that gives any in-flight focus-grab
//!    reflex time to fire and be observed by the suppressor before the
//!    lease is dropped. Matches Swift's `Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 50ms)`.
//! 3. A static `origin` label for tracing — call sites pass a short
//!    string like `"click.AXPress"` so leaked leases / late-firing
//!    observers can be traced back to the caller.

/// - `target_pid` — the pid the action is dispatched to. `Some(pid)` is
///   the standard case; `None` skips the targeted entry entirely

///   lease).
/// - `prior_frontmost` — the pid to restore focus to if the target
///   activates. Typically captured from `apps::frontmost_pid()` before
///   the snapshot.
/// - `origin` — short static label for tracing, e.g. `"click.AXPress"`.
/// - `f` — the action to run with suppression armed.
///
/// Returns whatever `f` returns. Drops the lease ~50ms after `f`
/// resolves so any in-flight reflex activation is observed before
/// suppression ends.

/// If `target_pid` is already the frontmost app (no point fighting
/// ourselves) or `prior_frontmost` is `None` (no app to restore to),
/// the function still runs `f` — just without the lease. This keeps
/// the call sites simple (no per-tool `if frontmost == target` ladders).
