//! PiP frame-push hook — registered once by `main.rs` when the
//! `--experimental-pip` flag is on argv.
//!
//! The trait + factory live in the `pip-preview` crate so the platform
//! backends can implement them without depending on `cua-driver-core`.
//! What lives here is just the per-process callback that the tool
//! dispatcher uses to push frames after each successful tool call —
//! a thin shim so `tool.rs` doesn't need to know about `pip-preview`
//! directly and we keep the dependency graph one-directional.
//!
//! The PNG bytes pushed through here come from the existing
//! `SCREENSHOT_FN` callback (the same source `screenshot.png` uses in
//! the recording pipeline), so PiP shows exactly what the recorder
//! captures.
