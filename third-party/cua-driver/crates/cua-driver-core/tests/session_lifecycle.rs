//! End-to-end session lifecycle / disposal test (cross-platform; runs on the Mac
//! via `cargo test -p cua-driver-core`).
//!
//! A session is a caller-declared identity that OWNS disposable per-run state:
//! the agent cursor, per-session config overrides, and any recording it started.
//! Those concrete registries live OUTSIDE this core crate:
//! - the agent cursor → `platform-macos::CursorRegistry` + the overlay,
//! - per-session config overrides → `platform-macos::SessionConfigRegistry`,
//! - the owned recording → stopped by `serve.rs`'s recording hook.
//!
//! None of them is reachable from a core-only test. They are ALL wired to
//! disposal through ONE mechanism: each registers a `register_session_end_hook`,
//! and BOTH teardown paths — `end_session` (explicit) and `evict_idle` (the
//! idle-TTL sweep) — dispose by fanning `fire_session_end` out to those hooks.
//!
//! This test therefore asserts disposal at the deepest deterministic layer
//! available in core: it registers its own stand-in hooks — one per real
//! production hook (cursor-remove, config-clear, recording-stop) — and proves
//! that EVERY one of them runs, exactly once, on BOTH `end_session` and
//! `evict_idle`. If the fan-out for either path regressed (e.g. the sweep stopped
//! disposing like `end_session`), these hooks would not fire and the test fails.
//!
//! What is only checkable at the daemon level (NOT asserted here): the actual
//! post-state of `platform-macos::CursorRegistry` / overlay / `SessionConfigRegistry`
//! and the daemon's `RecordingSession` — that requires a `serve`-layer/platform
//! integration test. Here we assert the hooks those registries hang off of fire on
//! both paths, which is the cross-platform half of the contract.
