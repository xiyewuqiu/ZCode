//! Terminal-emulator detection for the Linux `type_text` path.
//!
//! Linux already routes terminal typing through pty injection
//! (`inject_terminal_input` in tools/impl_.rs), but that detection is
//! gated on a process-name match. Terminals like Ghostty don't always
//! resolve to a clean `process_name` (the binary is reported as
//! `ghostty` but the WM_CLASS may be the user-facing name), and the
//! WM_CLASS-based fallback below covers the gap.
//!
//! WM_CLASS substrings here are matched case-insensitively against
//! both the instance and class fields of `WM_CLASS`. Adding a new
//! terminal: append a substring to [`TERMINAL_WM_CLASS_SUBSTRINGS`]
//! and to [`TERMINAL_PROCESS_NAMES`] if the binary name is known.

/// Substrings that, when found in a window's `WM_CLASS` instance or
/// class field (case-insensitive), identify a terminal emulator.
///
/// Used by [`is_terminal_window`] to back up the per-pid
/// `is_terminal_process` check — handy when the terminal's binary
/// name doesn't appear in the limited list but its WM_CLASS does.
